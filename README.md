# FortniteShop

Generates an image containing all items on the current Fortnite shop rotation.

## How does it work?

Get a transparent image of all items individually then generate a background color for it depending on the rarity of the item.

After that the icon is placed on a canvas that changes size depending on how many items are the shop.

## The Result
